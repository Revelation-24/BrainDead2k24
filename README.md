For Problem Statement 1 and  Problem Statement 2, prepare a concise report in .pptx or .pdf format and append it with the report you prepared in Problem Statement 1. 

Upload your .iPython notebook to Github and share the link with your repository via UnStop. 

Ensure that the repository is public.

Long story short, create a single concise report covering both the problem statements (if you have solved both), and upload the code for Problems 1 and 2 to Github.

Remember:

Both problem statements are compulsory.

You can submit whichever question you can solve. However, your score for the unsolved problem will be 0.

If you submit the report for Problem Statement 1 but not the .iPython notebook for Problem Statement 1 (or vice versa), your score for that problem will be 0.

<h2>Problem Statement 1: Analyze Rice Production Data In India and Predict Rice Production in Indian States/Union Territories.

 <h3>Challenge Description:
In this challenge, participants are tasked with predicting the production of rice on a state-wise or union territory-wise basis. The dataset provided spans from the agricultural sessions of 2004-2005 to 2022-2023, detailing the quantity of rice produced annually.

Analysis Goals:
Analyze the dataset and derive meaningful insights from the data.

Here are some examples that you might consider for your analysis:

- How does production vary from state to state (through bar charts, pie charts, etc.)?
- What is the state-wise rate of production?
- For which provinces there is need to improve their production of rice.
- You can use other instances, such as state-wise and year-wise rainfall in India. (Data link must be provided if including any instance)
- Present your analysis in a report. You can use charts, tables, and graphs to elaborate your analysis.
- In the end, any prediction model should be used to predict the state-wise/union territory-wise production of rice for the next 5 years.

Tools for Analysis:

Participants may use the following tools for analysis:
- MS Excel
- Tableau/PowerBI
- Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab with Matplotlib

Dataset Description:
The dataset is divided into three tables, from which Table 1 contains 34 rows and 10 columns, 

Table 2 contains 34 rows and 11 columns and 

Table 3 contains the source of the data (actually for data analysis and prediction there is no need of Table 3).

The first row of both Table 1 and Table 2 contains the title of the dataset.

From the second row, the dataset‚Äôs first column contains the name of the State/Union Territory, and 

the other columns contain the year-wise production of rice. 

The last row contains the year-wise all-over rice production in India.
