## Problem Statement 1: Analyze Rice Production Data In India and Predict Rice Production in Indian States/Union Territories


<div align="right"> <b> Marks = 40 </b></div>


***Problem Statement:***

In this challenge, participants are tasked with predicting the production of rice on a state-wise or union territory-wise basis. The dataset provided spans from the agricultural sessions of 2004-2005 to 2022-2023, detailing the quantity of rice produced annually.

***Analysis Goals:***

Analyze the dataset and derive meaningful insights from the data. Here are some examples that you might consider for your analysis:
- How does production vary from state to state (through bar charts, pie charts, etc.)?
- What is the state-wise rate of production?
- For which provinces there is a need to improve their production of rice.
- You can use other instances, such as state-wise and year-wise rainfall in India. (Data link must be provided if including any instance)
- Present your analysis in a report. You can use charts, tables, and graphs to elaborate your analysis.
- **In the end, any prediction model should be used to predict the state-wise/union territory-wise production of rice for the next 5 years.**

***Tools for Analysis:***
Participants may use the following tools for analysis:
- MS Excel
- Tableau/PowerBI
- Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab with Matplotlib

***Dataset Link:*** [BrainDead Rice Production Data in India](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/braindead2k24/brain-dead-rice-production-data-in-india)

***Dataset Description:***

The dataset is divided into three tables, from which Table 1 contains 34 rows and 10 columns, Table 2 contains 34 rows and 11 columns and Table 3 contains the source of the data (actually for data analysis and prediction there is no need of Table 3).

- The first row of both Table 1 and Table 2 contains the title of the dataset. 
- From the second row, the dataset‚Äôs first column contains the name of the State/Union Territory, and the other columns contain the year-wise production of rice. 
- The last row contains the year-wise all-over rice production in India.



***Deliverables:***

- A complete report of the analysis of the dataset and methodology employed in your work. The report should be concise. This report might include references, tables, figures, and results. **The methodology used for prediction must be clear**. If you are using tools like Excel, also mention the Excel formulas that you used for the analysis.
- Also submit the **source code** for the production of rice for the **next 5 years**.

***Marking Criteria:***

Participants will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- ***Writing style, references, and presentation of findings.***
- ***Dataset exploration.***
- ***Methodologies employed for analysis and prediction.***
- ***Source Code***
- ***Results and discussion.***

## Problem Statement 2: Detecting Multimodal Hate Speech in Internet Memes


<div align="right"> <b> Marks = 60 </b></div>

***Problem Statement:***

This competition aims to develop a **novel multimodal machine learning model** for classifying harmful internet memes that surpasses existing benchmark models while requiring less computation power. Internet memes, combining images and text, are pervasive online, but some carry harmful messages, necessitating effective detection methods. The challenge lies in creating a model that efficiently leverages **both image and text data** to identify **harmful content accurately**. Participants will be provided with a **dataset** containing labeled memes and tasked with training a model capable of achieving superior **performance compared to existing benchmarks while optimizing computational efficiency.**

***Dataset Link:*** [BrainDead Multimodal Data for Hateful Meme](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/braindead2k24/brain-dead-multimodal-data-for-hateful-meme)

***Dataset Description:***

The dataset provided for this competition comprises **10,000 data points**, each representing an internet meme and containing both image and text data. The image data is stored in a folder named "**img**," housing a diverse collection of meme images. Meanwhile, the text data is organized within a **CSV** file, where each row corresponds to a meme and includes the meme's ID, associated text, and class label denoting **harmful (1)** or **non-harmful (0)**. To facilitate multimodal analysis, participants will integrate both image and text data during model development, associating each meme's text with its corresponding image using the provided meme ID. This dataset serves as a foundation for training and evaluating advanced multimodal **machine learning models aimed at accurately classifying harmful memes** while optimizing computational efficiency.


***Deliverables:***

- A **novel multimodal machine learning model designed** for classifying **multimodal harmful internet memes that can handle images and text together.**
- Trained model(s) demonstrating superior performance compared to existing **benchmark models. (a few best classification benchmarks are given below).**
