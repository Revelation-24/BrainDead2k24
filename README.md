For Problem Statement 1 and  Problem Statement 2, prepare a concise report in .pptx or .pdf format and append it with the report you prepared in Problem Statement 1. 
Upload your .iPython notebook to Github and share the link with your repository via UnStop. 
Ensure that the repository is public.
Long story short, create a single concise report covering both the problem statements (if you have solved both), and upload the code for Problems 1 and 2 to Github.
Remember:
Both problem statements are compulsory.
You can submit whichever question you can solve. However, your score for the unsolved problem will be 0.
If you submit the report for Problem Statement 1 but not the .iPython notebook for Problem Statement 1 (or vice versa), your score for that problem will be 0.
